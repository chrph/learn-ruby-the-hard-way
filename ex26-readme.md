In this exercise, you will practice dealing with a bad programmer by fixing a bad programmer's code. I have poorly copied Exercises 24 and 25 into a file and removed random characters and added flaws. Most of the errors are things Ruby will tell you, while some of them are math errors you should find. Others are formatting errors or spelling mistakes in the strings.

All of these errors are very common mistakes all programmers make. Even experienced ones.

Your job in this exercise is to correct this file. Use all of your skills to make this file better. Analyze it first, maybe printing it out to edit it like you would a school term paper. Fix each flaw and keep running it and fixing it until the script runs perfectly. Try not to get help. If you get stuck take a break and come back to it later.

Even if this takes days to do, bust through it and make it right.

The point of this exercise isn't to type it in but to fix an existing file. To do that, you must go to this site:

Copy-paste the code into a file named ex26.rb. This is the only time you are allowed to copy-paste.
